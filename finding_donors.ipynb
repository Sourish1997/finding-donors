    "## Getting Started\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, you will employ several supervised algorithms of your choice to accurately model individuals' income using data collected from the 1994 U.S. Census. You will then choose the best candidate algorithm from preliminary results and further optimize this algorithm to best model the data. Your goal with this implementation is to construct a model that accurately predicts whether an individual makes more than $50,000. This sort of task can arise in a non-profit setting, where organizations survive on donations.  Understanding an individual's income can help a non-profit better understand how large of a donation to request, or whether or not they should reach out to begin with.  While it can be difficult to determine an individual's general income bracket directly from public sources, we can (as we will see) infer this value from other publically available features. \n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset for this project originates from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Census+Income). The datset was donated by Ron Kohavi and Barry Becker, after being published in the article _\"Scaling Up the Accuracy of Naive-Bayes Classifiers: A Decision-Tree Hybrid\"_. You can find the article by Ron Kohavi [online](https://www.aaai.org/Papers/KDD/1996/KDD96-033.pdf). The data we investigate here consists of small changes to the original dataset, such as removing the `'fnlwgt'` feature and records with missing or ill-formatted entries."

    "Before data can be used as input for machine learning algorithms, it often must be cleaned, formatted, and restructured — this is typically known as **preprocessing**. Fortunately, for this dataset, there are no invalid or missing entries we must deal with, however, there are some qualities about certain features that must be adjusted. This preprocessing can help tremendously with the outcome and predictive power of nearly all learning algorithms."

    "A dataset may sometimes contain at least one feature whose values tend to lie near a single number, but will also have a non-trivial number of vastly larger or smaller values than that single number.  Algorithms can be sensitive to such distributions of values and can underperform if the range is not properly normalized. With the census dataset two features fit this description: '`capital-gain'` and `'capital-loss'`. \n",

    "For highly-skewed feature distributions such as `'capital-gain'` and `'capital-loss'`, it is common practice to apply a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_transformation_(statistics)\">logarithmic transformation</a> on the data so that the very large and very small values do not negatively affect the performance of a learning algorithm. Using a logarithmic transformation significantly reduces the range of values caused by outliers. Care must be taken when applying this transformation however: The logarithm of `0` is undefined, so we must translate the values by a small amount above `0` to apply the the logarithm successfully.\n",

    "### Normalizing Numerical Features\n",
    "In addition to performing transformations on features that are highly skewed, it is often good practice to perform some type of scaling on numerical features. Applying a scaling to the data does not change the shape of each feature's distribution (such as `'capital-gain'` or `'capital-loss'` above); however, normalization ensures that each feature is treated equally when applying supervised learners. Note that once scaling is applied, observing the data in its raw form will no longer have the same original meaning, as exampled below.\n",
    "\n",
    "Run the code cell below to normalize each numerical feature. We will use [`sklearn.preprocessing.MinMaxScaler`](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.preprocessing.MinMaxScaler.html) for this."

    "From the table in **Exploring the Data** above, we can see there are several features for each record that are non-numeric. Typically, learning algorithms expect input to be numeric, which requires that non-numeric features (called *categorical variables*) be converted. One popular way to convert categorical variables is by using the **one-hot encoding** scheme. One-hot encoding creates a _\"dummy\"_ variable for each possible category of each non-numeric feature. For example, assume `someFeature` has three possible entries: `A`, `B`, or `C`. We then encode this feature into `someFeature_A`, `someFeature_B` and `someFeature_C`.\n",
    "\n",
    "|   | someFeature |                    | someFeature_A | someFeature_B | someFeature_C |\n",
    "| :-: | :-: |                            | :-: | :-: | :-: |\n",
    "| 0 |  B  |  | 0 | 1 | 0 |\n",
    "| 1 |  C  | ----> one-hot encode ----> | 0 | 0 | 1 |\n",
    "| 2 |  A  |  | 1 | 0 | 0 |\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, as with the non-numeric features, we need to convert the non-numeric target label, `'income'` to numerical values for the learning algorithm to work. Since there are only two possible categories for this label (\"<=50K\" and \">50K\"), we can avoid using one-hot encoding and simply encode these two categories as `0` and `1`, respectively. In code cell below, you will need to implement the following:\n",
    " - Use [`pandas.get_dummies()`](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.get_dummies.html?highlight=get_dummies#pandas.get_dummies) to perform one-hot encoding on the `'features_log_minmax_transform'` data.\n",
    " - Convert the target label `'income_raw'` to numerical entries.\n",
    "   - Set records with \"<=50K\" to `0` and records with \">50K\" to `1`."

    "### Metrics and the Naive Predictor\n",
    "*CharityML*, equipped with their research, knows individuals that make more than \\$50,000 are most likely to donate to their charity. Because of this, *CharityML* is particularly interested in predicting who makes more than \\$50,000 accurately. It would seem that using **accuracy** as a metric for evaluating a particular model's performace would be appropriate. Additionally, identifying someone that *does not* make more than \\$50,000 as someone who does would be detrimental to *CharityML*, since they are looking to find individuals willing to donate. Therefore, a model's ability to precisely predict those that make more than \\$50,000 is *more important* than the model's ability to **recall** those individuals. We can use **F-beta score** as a metric that considers both precision and recall:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ F_{\\beta} = (1 + \\beta^2) \\cdot \\frac{precision \\cdot recall}{\\left( \\beta^2 \\cdot precision \\right) + recall} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "In particular, when $\\beta = 0.5$, more emphasis is placed on precision. This is called the **F$_{0.5}$ score** (or F-score for simplicity).\n",
    "\n",
    "Looking at the distribution of classes (those who make at most \\$50,000, and those who make more), it's clear most individuals do not make more than \\$50,000. This can greatly affect **accuracy**, since we could simply say *\"this person does not make more than \\$50,000\"* and generally be right, without ever looking at the data! Making such a statement would be called **naive**, since we have not considered any information to substantiate the claim. It is always important to consider the *naive prediction* for your data, to help establish a benchmark for whether a model is performing well. That been said, using that prediction would be pointless: If we predicted all people made less than \\$50,000, *CharityML* would identify no one as donors. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Note: Recap of accuracy, precision, recall\n",
    "\n",
    "** Accuracy ** measures how often the classifier makes the correct prediction. It’s the ratio of the number of correct predictions to the total number of predictions (the number of test data points).\n",
    "\n",
    "** Precision ** tells us what proportion of messages we classified as spam, actually were spam.\n",
    "It is a ratio of true positives(words classified as spam, and which are actually spam) to all positives(all words classified as spam, irrespective of whether that was the correct classificatio), in other words it is the ratio of\n",
    "\n",
    "`[True Positives/(True Positives + False Positives)]`\n",
    "\n",
    "** Recall(sensitivity)** tells us what proportion of messages that actually were spam were classified by us as spam.\n",
    "It is a ratio of true positives(words classified as spam, and which are actually spam) to all the words that were actually spam, in other words it is the ratio of\n",
    "\n",
    "`[True Positives/(True Positives + False Negatives)]`\n",
    "\n",
    "For classification problems that are skewed in their classification distributions like in our case, for example if we had a 100 text messages and only 2 were spam and the rest 98 weren't, accuracy by itself is not a very good metric. We could classify 90 messages as not spam(including the 2 that were spam but we classify them as not spam, hence they would be false negatives) and 10 as spam(all 10 false positives) and still get a reasonably good accuracy score. For such cases, precision and recall come in very handy. These two metrics can be combined to get the F1 score, which is weighted average(harmonic mean) of the precision and recall scores. This score can range from 0 to 1, with 1 being the best possible F1 score(we take the harmonic mean as we are dealing with ratios)."

    "### Gaussian Naive Bayes\n",
    "\n",
    "- Naive Bayes is often used to classify documents into one or more categories based on the presence or absence of particular keywords. A particular example is the classification of email as spam or not spam, where the feature set can be the presence or absence of particular words, attributes of the email such as its length, sender, whether it was directly sent or broadcasted, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Strengths of the Naive Bayes model: It is very simple to implement. It works well with limited training data as it is a high bias, low variance classifier. It converges quicker than discriminative models (models that learn the joint probability distrinution as opposed to the conditional probability distribution), specially if the assumption of conditional independence between the features hold. Even if this assumption of the Naive Bayes model does not hold, it is seen to perform well in practice.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Weaknesses of the Naive Bayes model: The main weakness of the Naive Bayes model is that it is unable to learn the interactions between features. This stems from the model's assumption of conditional independence with respect to features.\n",
    "\n",
    "- I believe that Naive Bayes is a good candidate for the problem as most of the features do not appear to be directly dependent in any way, and hence the model should perform well. Also, the amount of data grows exponentially with the increse in number of features (curse of dimensionality). Since we are performing the classification on a large number of features, the training set seems to be small in comparison (only 45222 records). Naive Bayes works well with limited training data, and that is one more reason to choose it for this problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Ensemble Methods - AdaBoost\n",
    "\n",
    "- AdaBoost (Adaptive Boosting) is an ensemble learner which can be used in conjunction with many other types of weak learners to improve their performance. One real life application is in the training of chat bots using one level decision trees as the weak learner. Each decison tree splits the data based on a single feature at an optimal threshold. The data that it misclassifies are given greater weights and another decision tree is fit to the data. This process is carried out iteratively and all the resultant decision trees are combined by means of a weighted mean to give a final model which maps the features in any given question to the most likely answer.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Strengths of the AdaBoost Model: AdaBoost with one level decision trees as the weak learner is often referred to as the 'best out of the box classifier'. It has the great property of selecting only those features which are known to improve the predictive power of the model, reducing dimensionality and potentially improving execution time as irrelevant features do not need to be computed, unlike neural networks and SVMs. It also has the amazing property of not overfitting on adding nore and nore training iterations. Instead of increasing the cross validation error after a certain number of iterations, this in turn increases the margin of the resultant classifier.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Weaknesses of the AdaBoost Model: The primary weakness of AdaBoost is that it will overfit if the underlying weak learner tends to overfit. In this sense, the success of the classification is highly dependent on the underlying learner chosen. Boosting has also been shown to overfit when the data has pink (uniform) noise.\n",
    "\n",
    "- I believe that AdaBoost is a good candidate for this problem because of its property of selecting only those features which are known to improve the predictive power of the model. This is because our feature space has a high dimensionality and I feel certain features like marital status, relationship, etc will not have any visible effect on improving the predictive power of our model.\n",

    "### Support Vector Machines (SVM)\n",
    "\n",
    "- One real world application of Support Vector Machines is in the field of computational biology for protein remote homology detection. The most effective method to solve this problem is using SVM. SVM algorithms have been extensively applied for protein remote homology detection. These algorithms have been widely used for identifying biological sequences. Particular examples are classification of genes, patients on the basis of their genes, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Strengths of the SVM Model: Support Vector Machines are known for their high accuracy and theoretical guarantees regarding overfitting. Also, with an appropriate kernel they can work well even if the data is not linearly separable in the base feature space. SVM also works well in classification problems with very high-dimensional feature spaces.  \n",
    "\n",
    "- Weaknesses of the SVM Model: Implementation of SVM is memory-intensive and the trainning process is slow (cubic of the size of the dataset). Hence, it is not a good option for use with very large datasets. It is also hard to interpret and visualize due to concepts like the kernel trick where a non linear separator is transformed into a linear separator in higer dimensions. It also does not work very well if the data has a lot of noise.\n",
    "\n",
    "- I believe that SVM is a good candidate for this problem as it is known to work well with high dimensional feature spaces. It is also known to work well in competitive domains where there is a clear margin of separation which I believe will be the case in our problem.\n",

    "- Metrics: The F score on the testing set when 100\\% of the training data is used is the greatest in the case of the AdaBoost Classifier. It also outperforms the Naive Bayes Classifier and the SVM classifier both when 10\\% and 1\\% of the training data is used. \n",

    "- Prediction/Training Time: The prediction and training time for AdaBoost is very low with respect to the SVM classifier and comparable to the Naive Bayes classifier. However, the Naive Bayes calssifer is seen to perform poorly and hence, the AdaBoost classifier emerges as the primary choice.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Algorithms Suitability for the data: We are performing the training on a large feature space, with some features that do not seem to correlate with the target. Also, the number of data entries is small when compared to the dimensionality of our feature space. AdaBoost has the property of selecting only those features which are known to improve the predictive power of the model and hence have the effect of indirectly reducing the dimensionality of the feature space. Therefore, I feel that it is well suited to our data."

Initially we weight all the data entries in the training set equally, that is, all of them are given equal importance. We then train our weak learner on the data to obtain a classifer. We then assign higher weights to the points that the classifier predicts correctly and lower weights to the points that the classifier predicts incorrectly. In this way, we make it more important for the weak learner to get the points that it got wrong right on the next iteration. We then train the learner over this new weighted data and obtain another classifier. We again readjust the weights based on the learner's predictions. We carry out this process iteratively N times to obtain N classifiers. Our final classifier is then obtained by performing a weighted mean on all the classifiers obtained. The classifiers are weighted based on a measure of how well they perform with respect to the underlying data. This final classifier can now be given any new feature set that it has never encountered before, and it will output a classification. More specifically, the classification is obtained after the output of the weighted mean on all the classifiers is passed through a thresholding function, which gives the classification."

    "**Answer:**\n",
    "\n",
    "The five features that I believe are the most important for prediction are (1 - Highest Rank, 5 - Lowest Rank):\n",
    "\n",
    "1. education-num: Education number is representative of the individual's level of education. A highly educated individual is expected to earn much more than someone who is less educated. Therefore, I believe that this will turn out to be the most important feature for the prediction.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. capital-gain: Capital gain is the total increase in value of capital assets. The capital gain not only gives us a number that tells us by how much an individual got richer, the order of the capital gain also gives us an estimate of the person's wealth. That is, a person's capital gain can be very large only if he already has a lot of valuable assets, which in turn indicates that his earnings must be large.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. capital-loss: Capital loss is the total decrease in value of capital assets. This measure gives us information similar to that of capital gain. It not only tells us by how much an individual got poorer, but also gives us an estimate of the person's wealth via the order of the capital loss. That is, a person's capital loss can be large only if he already has a lot of valuable assets, which in turn indicates that his earnings must be large. I rank capital gain and capital loss below education-num because even though a person might be very rich, his capital gain or loss might be low, and in these situations, the features do not give us a lot of valuable information.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. hours-per-week: The number of hours per week that a person works is directly related to his/her salary. A person who works for long hours can either be at a very high position like a manager, CEO or director, in which case the hogh number of hours-per-week should correspond to high income. However, people who have low paying jobs, also often require long working hours. Therefore, I feel that the classification based on hours-per-week is split at high values of the variable. However at low values of the feature, a negative classification should be the trend.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. occupation: Occupation is often directly related to income. There are certain occupations which require specialized skillsets and are therefore very higly paying. Several other jobs like that of clerks, farmers, fishermen, handlers-cleaners are generally low paying. However, classification based on occupation is ambiguous for several occupations like that of executive or managerial positions, where there exists a large range of salaries."

    "Capital loss, capital gain, hours per week and education number are common between the five features that I chose and those output by the model. The only different feature is age instead of occupation whixh I believed was more relevant. However, education number has the least weight whereas I gave it the highest rank. I guess that the level of education achieved by an individual is not directly related to his/her income after all. This might be because a higher level of education in certain fields fetch higer income jobs than others. For example, a computer engineering undergraduate is expected to land a higher paying job than an undergranduate in english or social sciences. I also realize now that age or seniority plays a much more important role than I originally believed. Senior individuals are much more likely to have the highest paying jobs, due to their experience. That is why it is the second most important feature after capital loss. I also thought that capital loss and capital gain would have almost the same importance. However, it is seen that capital loss has much more importance than capital gain. However, I have no good guess for why this is the case. I got the rank for hours per week correct. And because of age that makes an entry as the second most important parameter, I believe occupation gets pushed out of the top five. Like I mentioned above, I feel that occupation is less relevant due to its ambiguous nature with respect to classification for several different occupation like executive and managerial positions."

    "### Feature Selection\n",
    "How does a model perform if we only use a subset of all the available features in the data? With less features required to train, the expectation is that training and prediction time is much lower — at the cost of performance metrics. From the visualization above, we see that the top five most important features contribute more than half of the importance of **all** features present in the data. This hints that we can attempt to *reduce the feature space* and simplify the information required for the model to learn. The code cell below will use the same optimized model you found earlier, and train it on the same training set *with only the top five important features*. "

This is less than the 0.7452 and 0.8677 values of F-score and accuracy score respectibvely for the final model trained on the whole data. However, when compared to the large reduction in feature space, the decrease in F-score and accuracy is not very high (0.0449 and 0.0256 respectively). Thus, the final model does fairly well even when it is trained on the reduced feature space.\n",
